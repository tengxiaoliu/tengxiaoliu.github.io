I'm Tengxiao Liu, a third-year MSc student at Fudan University, advised by Prof. [Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io). Meanwhile, I'm currently a research intern at AWS Shanghai AI Lab, working closely with Prof. [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/) and Prof. [Zheng Zhang](https://research.shanghai.nyu.edu/cn/centers-and-institutes/datascience/people/zheng-zhang).
Before joining Fudan, I received my bachelor degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2021.

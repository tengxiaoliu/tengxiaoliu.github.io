I'm Tengxiao Liu, a third-year MSc student at Fudan University, advised by Prof. [Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io). I'm currently a research intern at AWS Shanghai AI Lab, working closely with Prof. [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/) and Prof. [Zheng Zhang](https://research.shanghai.nyu.edu/cn/centers-and-institutes/datascience/people/zheng-zhang).
Before joining Fudan, I received my bachelor degree from Special Gifted Young Program at Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2021. Here's my [CV](https://tengxiaoliu.github.io/file/cv_Tengxiao_Liu.pdf).

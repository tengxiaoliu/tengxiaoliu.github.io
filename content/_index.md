I'm Tengxiao Liu, a first-year Ph.D. student at University of California, Santa Barbara, advised by Prof. [William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/). I obtained my Master's at Fudan University, advised by Prof. [Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io). I was fortunate to work as a research intern at the AWS Shanghai AI Lab, collaborating closely with Prof. [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/) and Prof. [Zheng Zhang](https://research.shanghai.nyu.edu/cn/centers-and-institutes/datascience/people/zheng-zhang). I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science from Special Gifted Young Program at Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2021. Here's my [CV](https://tengxiaoliu.github.io/file/cv_Tengxiao_Liu.pdf).
